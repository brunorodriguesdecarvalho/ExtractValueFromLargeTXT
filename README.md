#Extracting values from large text files

A sample of how to work with large text files (~2GB) with one JSON per line to extract a value.

Files:
  + leitorJSON.py (reads the txt file and helps the user search for a customer name or ID {CPF}) 
  + largeFile.zip (a zip file containting a text file which is an extremely simple example - GitHub does not allows text files larger than 25Mb)

PS - The text file contains duplicated IDs and names and there is no unique value.
